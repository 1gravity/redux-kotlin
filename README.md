A redux standard for Kotlin that supports multiplatform projects

## Misson Statement

Provide a stadard redux for Kotlin in order to foster a ecosystem of middleware, store enhancers, & dev tools.  These core values will guide descisions for the project:
* core redux-kotlin will be a minimal implementation that other libraries can build upon
* modular development (follow example of https://github.com/reduxjs)
* support for all platforms supported by Kotlin multiplatform (JVM, iOS, Native, JS, WASM)
* developed in open and enable discussion for all interested parties via open channels (slack, github, etc. TBD)
* not owned by a individual or company


Redux in Kotlin, and in mobile in particular, may differ a bit from javascript.  Many have found the basic pattern useful on Android & iOS leading to tens of opensource redux libraries in Kotlin, Java, and Swift, yet an ecosystem has yet to emerge.  A port of javascript redux is a good starting point and in doing so will aid in cross-pollination of middleware, store enhancers, & dev tools from the javascript world.  

Redux has proven helpful for state managment in mobile and having a multiplatform Kotlin implementation & ecosystem will increase developer productivity.
